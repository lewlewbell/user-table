## Configuration

1. Run 'npm install', this will automatically install all node modules required for this project
2. Run 'gulp sass', this will build all project SASS into minified production-ready CSS
3. Run 'gulp', this will start up a local server -- address will be noted in the terminal results. This will also watch for any code changes and update on-the-fly.

## Future updates

Although this has been academic, in a real life scenario there would be a number of improvements I would make to this project given time:

1. Refactor much of the code using BEM methodology
2. Making more use of the Bootstrap framework
3. Consider converting much of the CSS units to "em" measurements so we can tie the design with the typography
4. Much more improvements to typography and code-reuse
5. User analytics to understand how users are using this application
6. More in depth design review, perhaps working with the design team to help polish off the remains
7. Finish rigging this up to a json feed, and migrating the UI template into AngularJS components.
